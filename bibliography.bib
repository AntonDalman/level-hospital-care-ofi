  abstract  = "The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) began 30 years ago with
               the goal of providing timely, valid and relevant assessments of
               critical health outcomes. Over this period, the GBD has become
               progressively more granular. The latest iteration provides
               assessments of thousands of outcomes for diseases, injuries and
               risk factors in more than 200 countries and territories and at
               the subnational level in more than 20 countries. The GBD is now
               produced by an active collaboration of over 8,000 scientists and
               analysts from more than 150 countries. With each GBD iteration,
               the data, data processing and methods used for data synthesis
               have evolved, with the goal of enhancing transparency and
               comparability of measurements and communicating various sources
               of uncertainty. The GBD has many limitations, but it remains a
               dynamic, iterative and rigorous attempt to provide meaningful

               since been published based on that template, reflecting a lack
               of international consensus on its feasibility and use. The aim
               of the present revision was to further develop the Utstein
               Template, particularly with a major reduction in the number of
               core data variables and the addition of more precise definitions
               of data variables. In addition, we wanted to define a set of
               inclusion and exclusion criteria that will facilitate uniform
               comparison of trauma cases. METHODS: Over a ten-month period,
               selected experts from major European trauma registries and
               organisations carried out an Utstein consensus process based on
               a modified nominal group technique. RESULTS: The expert panel
               concluded that a New Injury Severity Score > 15 should be used
               as a single inclusion criterion, and five exclusion criteria
               were also selected. Thirty-five precisely defined core data
               variables were agreed upon, with further division into core data
               for Predictive models, System Characteristic Descriptors and for
               Process Mapping. CONCLUSION: Through a structured consensus
               process, the Utstein Template for Uniform Reporting of Data
               following Major Trauma has been revised. This revision will
               enhance national and international comparisons of trauma
               systems, and will form the basis for improved prediction models

               designed to provide information that can be used to improve the
               efficiency and quality of trauma care. Indeed, the combination
               of trauma registry data at regional or national levels can
               produce very large databases that allow unprecedented
               opportunities for the evaluation of patient outcomes and

               aggregated trauma data sets rarely represent a population-based

              identifying opportunities for improvement (OFI). The aim of this
              study was to assess how patient and process factors are
              associated with OFI in trauma care. METHODS: We conducted a
              registry-based study using all patients between 2017 and 2021
              from the Karolinska University Hospital who had been reviewed
              regarding the presence of OFI as defined by a morbidity and
              mortality conference. We used bi- and multivariable logistic
              regression to assess the associations between the following
              patient and process factors and OFI: age, sex, respiratory rate,
              systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury
              Severity Score (ISS), survival at 30 days, highest hospital care

               across all clinical settings, including the emergency department
               (ED). We conducted a systematic review to determine the most
               frequent diseases and clinical presentations associated with
               diagnostic errors (and resulting harms) in the ED, measure error
               and harm frequency, as well as assess causal factors. Methods.
               We searched PubMed\textregistered{}, Cumulative Index to Nursing
               and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL\textregistered{}), and
               Embase\textregistered{} from January 2000 through September
               2021. We included research studies and targeted grey literature
               reporting diagnostic errors or misdiagnosis-related harms in EDs
               in the United States or other developed countries with ED care
               deemed comparable by a technical expert panel. We applied
               standard definitions for diagnostic errors, misdiagnosis-related
               harms (adverse events), and serious harms (permanent disability
               or death). Preventability was determined by original study
               authors or differences in harms across groups. Two reviewers
               independently screened search results for eligibility; serially
               extracted data regarding common diseases, error/harm rates, and
               causes/risk factors; and independently assessed risk of bias of
               included studies. We synthesized results for each question and
               extrapolated U.S. estimates. We present 95 percent confidence
               intervals (CIs) or plausible range (PR) bounds, as appropriate.
               Results. We identified 19,127 citations and included 279
               studies. The top 15 clinical conditions associated with serious
               misdiagnosis-related harms (accounting for 68\% [95\% CI 66 to
               71] of serious harms) were (1) stroke, (2) myocardial
               infarction, (3) aortic aneurysm and dissection, (4) spinal cord
               compression and injury, (5) venous thromboembolism, (6/7 -- tie)
               meningitis and encephalitis, (6/7 -- tie) sepsis, (8) lung
               cancer, (9) traumatic brain injury and traumatic intracranial
               hemorrhage, (10) arterial thromboembolism, (11) spinal and
               intracranial abscess, (12) cardiac arrhythmia, (13) pneumonia,
               (14) gastrointestinal perforation and rupture, and (15)
               intestinal obstruction. Average disease-specific error rates
               ranged from 1.5 percent (myocardial infarction) to 56 percent
               (spinal abscess), with additional variation by clinical
               presentation (e.g., missed stroke average 17\%, but 4\% for
               weakness and 40\% for dizziness/vertigo). There was also wide,
               superimposed variation by hospital (e.g., missed myocardial
               infarction 0\% to 29\% across hospitals within a single study).
               An estimated 5.7 percent (95\% CI 4.4 to 7.1) of all ED visits
               had at least one diagnostic error. Estimated preventable adverse
               event rates were as follows: any harm severity (2.0\%, 95\% CI
               1.0 to 3.6), any serious harms (0.3\%, PR 0.1 to 0.7), and
               deaths (0.2\%, PR 0.1 to 0.4). While most disease-specific error
               rates derived from mainly U.S.-based studies, overall error and
               harm rates were derived from three prospective studies conducted
               outside the United States (in Canada, Spain, and Switzerland,
               with combined n=1,758). If overall rates are generalizable to
               all U.S. ED visits (130 million, 95\% CI 116 to 144), this would
               translate to 7.4 million (PR 5.1 to 10.2) ED diagnostic errors
               annually; 2.6 million (PR 1.1 to 5.2) diagnostic adverse events
               with preventable harms; and 371,000 (PR 142,000 to 909,000)
               serious misdiagnosis-related harms, including more than 100,000
               permanent, high-severity disabilities and 250,000 deaths.
               Although errors were often multifactorial, 89 percent (95\% CI
               88 to 90) of diagnostic error malpractice claims involved
               failures of clinical decision-making or judgment, regardless of
               the underlying disease present. Key process failures were errors
               in diagnostic assessment, test ordering, and test
               interpretation. Most often these were attributed to inadequate
               knowledge, skills, or reasoning, particularly in ``atypical'' or
               otherwise subtle case presentations. Limitations included use of
               malpractice claims and incident reports for distribution of
               diseases leading to serious harms, reliance on a small number of
               non-U.S. studies for overall (disease-agnostic) diagnostic error
               and harm rates, and methodologic variability across studies in
               measuring disease-specific rates, determining preventability,
               and assessing causal factors. Conclusions. Although estimated ED
               error rates are low (and comparable to those found in other
               clinical settings), the number of patients potentially impacted
               is large. Not all diagnostic errors or harms are preventable,
               but wide variability in diagnostic error rates across diseases,
               symptoms, and hospitals suggests improvement is possible. With
               130 million U.S. ED visits, estimated rates for diagnostic error
               (5.7\%), misdiagnosis-related harms (2.0\%), and serious
               misdiagnosis-related harms (0.3\%) could translate to more than
               7 million errors, 2.5 million harms, and 350,000 patients
               suffering potentially preventable permanent disability or death.
               Over two-thirds of serious harms are attributable to just 15
               diseases and linked to cognitive errors, particularly in cases
               with ``atypical'' manifestations. Scalable solutions to enhance
               bedside diagnostic processes are needed, and these should target
               the most commonly misdiagnosed clinical presentations of key
               diseases causing serious harms. New studies should confirm
               overall rates are representative of current U.S.-based ED
               practice and focus on identified evidence gaps (errors among
               common diseases with lower-severity harms, pediatric ED errors
               and harms, dynamic systems factors such as overcrowding, and
               false positives). Policy changes to consider based on this
               review include: (1) standardizing measurement and research
               results reporting to maximize comparability of measures of
               diagnostic error and misdiagnosis-related harms; (2) creating a
               National Diagnostic Performance Dashboard to track performance;
               and (3) using multiple policy levers (e.g., research funding,
               public accountability, payment reforms) to facilitate the rapid
               development and deployment of solutions to address this
               critically important patient safety concern.",

               patients with predominantly cardiovascular and pulmonary
               disorders admitted between December 2002 and February 2003 were
               enrolled. Demographic data, SAPS II, and TISS-28 were obtained

               detailed descriptions on how, why and when to use the IRF were
               provided. RESULTS: During the observation period of 64 days, 50

               nervous system activation. It is also important to note that
               each person responds differently to trauma, and underlying

               produce very large databases that allow unprecedented
               opportunities for the evaluation of patient outcomes and

               Trauma released the Tenth Edition of the Advanced Trauma Life
               Support (ATLS) course. For providers, ATLS forms the framework
               used in the assessment and treatment of patients who suffer
               traumatic injuries. Above all else, the guiding principles of
               ATLS are both the primary and secondary surveys. The utilization
               of these surveys and the skills that accompany them allow all
               interprofessional team members to treat patients under one
               standardized method and communicate using one common language.
               This streamlines the assessment and treatment of every patient,
               allowing them to receive definitive care faster and improve
               their outcomes. The advantage of ATLS is made evident during
               moments of stress. Because of the time-sensitive nature of these
               cases, added stressors, such as a provider's limited knowledge
               of the patient's mechanism of injury or history, can be
               overwhelming. ATLS acts as a tool to cognitively off-load these
               distractions and gives the provider more time to analyze their
               patients and communicate more effectively with their team.
               Trauma care principles will highlight the fundamental skills of
               ATLS and provide its readers with essential knowledge that

  author    = "Graber, Mark",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Medical diagnoses that are wrong, missed, or delayed
               make up a large fraction of all medical errors and cause
               substantial suffering and injury. Compared with other types of
               medical error, however, diagnostic errors receive little
               attention-a major factor in perpetuating unacceptable rates of
               diagnostic error. Diagnostic errors are fundamentally obscure,
               health care organizations have not viewed them as a system
               problem, and physicians responsible for making medical decisions
               seldom perceive their own error rates as problematic. The safety
               of modem health care can be improved if these three issues are
               understood and addressed. SOLUTIONS: Opportunities to improve
               the visibility of diagnostic errors are evident. Diagnostic
               error needs to be included in the normal spectrum of quality
               assurance surveillance and review. The system properties that
               contribute to diagnostic errors need to be systematically
               identified and addressed, including issues related to reliable
               diagnostic testing processes. Even for cases entirely dependent
               on the skill of the clinician for accurate diagnosis, health
               care organizations could minimize errors by using system-level
               interventions to aid the clinician, such as second readings of
               key diagnostic tests and providing resources for clinical
               decision support. Physicians need to improve their calibration
               by getting feedback on the diagnoses they make. Finally,
               clinicians need to learn about overconfidence and other innate
               cognitive tendencies that detract from optimal reasoning and
               learning. CONCLUSION: Clinicians and their health care

               it is essential that, despite this, patient care remains safe
               and of high quality. Adverse events (AEs) are supposed to be
               reported to internal quality control systems by health-care
               providers, but many are never reported. Patients on the
               intensive care unit (ICU) are at special risk for AEs. Our aim
               was to identify the incidence and characteristics of AEs in
               patients who died on the ICU during a 2-year period. METHODS: A
               structured record review according to the Global Trigger Tool
               (GTT) was used to review charts from patients cared for at the
               ICU of a middle-sized Swedish hospital during 2007 and 2008 and
               who died during or immediately after ICU care. All identified
               AEs were scored according to severity and preventability.
               RESULTS: We reviewed 128 records, and 41 different AEs were
               identified in 25 patients (19.5\%). Health care-associated
               infections, hypoglycaemia, pressure sores and procedural
               complications were the most common harmful events. Twenty two
               (54\%) of the AEs were classified as being avoidable. Two of the
               41 AEs were reported as complications according to the Swedish
               Intensive Care Registry, and one AE had been reported in the
               internal AE-reporting system. CONCLUSION: Almost one fifth of
               the patients who died on the ICU were subjected to harmful
               events. GTT has the advantage of identifying more patient
               injuries caused by AEs than the traditional AE-reporting systems

               died during their initial hospital admission during an 8-year
               period (January, 1998 to December, 2005) were analyzed. The
               deaths were initially reviewed at a weekly Morbidity and
               Mortality (M\&M) conference followed by a multidisciplinary
               (Trauma Surgery, Critical Care, Emergency Medicine,
               Neurosurgery, Nursing, and Coroner) Combined Trauma Death Review
               Committee, and were classified into nonpreventable, potentially
               preventable, and preventable deaths. All preventable and
               potentially preventable deaths were identified for the purpose
               of the study. Quality improvement death forms included data on
               epidemiology, vital signs, injury severity, type of injury,

               methodology, preventability (nonpreventable, potentially

               and management of the patient, and classification of errors
               (system, judgment, knowledge). Additional injury details,
               clinical course, circumstances leading to the death and autopsy
               findings were abstracted from the trauma registry and individual
               chart review. RESULTS: During the study period, 35,311 patients
               meeting trauma registry criteria were admitted and a total of
               2,081 (5.9\%) deaths occurred. Fifty-one deaths were classified
               as preventable or potentially preventable deaths (0.1\% of
               admissions, 2.5\% of deaths). Eleven of them (0.53\% of deaths)
               were classified as preventable and 40 (1.92\% of deaths) as
               potentially preventable deaths. Mean age was 40 years, 66.7\%
               were men, mean Injury Severity Score was 27, 74.5\% were blunt.
               The most common cause of death was bleeding (20, 39.2\%)
               followed by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (14, 27.5\%) and
               cardiorespiratory arrest (8, 15.6\%). This was caused by a delay
               in treatment (27, 52.9\%), clinical judgment error (11, 21.6\%),
               missed diagnosis (6, 11.8\%), technical error (4, 7.8\%), and
               other (3, 5.9\%). The deaths peaked at two time periods: 26
               (51.1\%) during the first 24 hours and 16 (31.4\%) after 7 days.
               Only one patient (2.0\%) died in the first hour. The most common
               location of death was the intensive care unit (28, 54.9\%),
               operating room (13, 25.5\%), and emergency room (5, 9.8\%).
               CONCLUSION: Preventable or potentially preventable deaths are
               rare but do occur at an academic Level I trauma center. Delay in
