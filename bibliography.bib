  abstract  = "The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) began 30 years ago with
               the goal of providing timely, valid and relevant assessments of
               critical health outcomes. Over this period, the GBD has become
               progressively more granular. The latest iteration provides
               assessments of thousands of outcomes for diseases, injuries and
               risk factors in more than 200 countries and territories and at
               the subnational level in more than 20 countries. The GBD is now
               produced by an active collaboration of over 8,000 scientists and
               analysts from more than 150 countries. With each GBD iteration,
               the data, data processing and methods used for data synthesis
               have evolved, with the goal of enhancing transparency and
               comparability of measurements and communicating various sources
               of uncertainty. The GBD has many limitations, but it remains a
               dynamic, iterative and rigorous attempt to provide meaningful
               health measurement to a wide range of stakeholders.",
