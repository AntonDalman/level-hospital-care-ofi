# Introduction

*This is part A) in the project plan [sv: projektredogörelse].*

Background Trauma is a global issue affecting millions of people every
year worldwide. The exact numbers differ due to different methods of
gathering data, and data availability. Worldwide, somewhere between 4-6
million people die every year due to trauma, and around 40 million get
permanently injured and 100 million people get temporarily injured each
year (cite). In Sweden, during 2023, 5221 people died due to trauma
(cite)The level of care a trauma patient receive can differ between
hospitals, regions and countries. The level of care can differ according
to severity of injury, but also according to local regulations, space
and economical concerns. Level of care can be summarized according to
five categories. In order of most care to least care is emergency
department, general ward, operating theatre, high dependency unit and
critical care unit. These are based on the Utstein template for
reporting trauma and are logged in the Karolinska Hospital trauma
registry which will be used for this article. The American college of
surgeons (ACS) also have a template which divide patient care in levels
from I-V. I is comparable to a large hospital with best of the line
trauma care, including a critical care unit, while V is more comparable
to a smaller regional emergency centre (CITE). Several studies have been
made on the subject of levels of care on these care levels and will be
discussed in the discussion part of this article, despite the difference
between ACS care levels and the Utstein template. Depending on the
severity of the injury each patient supposedly ends up in a higher care
level. A higher care level equals more doctors, nurses and staff, as
well as access to more complex machinery. However, it also equals a
higher cost, and a larger drain of resources. In Sweden, as well as
worldwide (cite/cite), triage is used in order for a patient to end up
at the right care level. There is always however risk for under- or over
triage. In general, both in Sweden and worldwide, we would prefer to
over triage patients rather than under triage them. This means that we
would rather a less severe patient end up in higher-level care than a
more severe patient end up in a lower level of care. In Sweden during
2018, 49.9% of patients were over triaged while 11.2% were under triaged
(CITE). The authors of this study discussed that these numbers may not
be completely representative of the data due to changes in how to
measure triage, however the same general trend would show, were under
triage is generally rather uncommon compared to over triage. This is
comparable to numbers globally. The risk of under triaging patient
equals a higher mortality rate (CITE), a higher morbidity rate (CITE),
as well as a high economical burden. Compared to over triaging patients,
the risk of morbidity and mortality decrease but the risk of high cost
remains. Since it's more common to over triage a patient compared to the
opposite, the higher economical cost comes from over triaging. Triage is
a large part of why a patient ends up in a specific care level, and may
be a large part of were opportunities for improvement may be found. It's
not the only one, however. Within different level of care, there are
different sources of improvement opportunities.

Each of these categories possibly have their own set of problems and
opportunities for improvement. According to study (cite), many patients
stay too long in the emergency ward before reaching the level of care
required for treatment. On the other hand, studies show (cite) that
there is a correlation with a longer stay in a critical care unit and
patient recovery. We will discuss reasons for this in the discussion
part of this paper.\
In this paper we aim at looking at opportunities for improvement
regarding level of care. Opportunities for improvement can be
categorized as factors affecting morbidity and mortality. We will also
discuss whether patients end up in the right care level according to the
severity of their injuries, or if they end up in a potentially higher
care level then required, thus costing money and resources.
Opportunities for improvement is since 2017 measured by a specialized
nurse, who in Karolinska hospital reviews all trauma patient cases and
flags cases where OFI might be found. The cases flagged then get
reviewed at a deeper level by another specialized nurse, and the cases
where OFI might be found gets reviewed by a multidisciplinary
conference, where cases are either admitted or discarded. All patients
dying due to trauma are also discussed in a conference where OFI is also
discussed. Before 2017 OFI was decided by a smaller group of clinicians
(HAR EJ KÄLLA PÅ DETTA, ÄR DET OK ATT ANVÄNDA HUSSEINS ARTIKEL?)
Opportunities for improvement include factors affecting mortality and
morbidity. The ones included are the following: clinical judgment
errors, delays in treatment or diagnosis, missed diagnoses, technical
errors, preventable deaths and other errors. Clinical judgment errors
are somewhat common in the emergency ward, according to a systematic
review published in 2022. There 5.7 percent of patients had at least one
diagnostical error, resulting in harm becoming 2 percent of patients and
death in about 0.2. These percentages are low, but due to the traffic
emergency wards receive -- about 130 million patients every year in the
US, which means that 7 millions of these are misdiagnosed, resulting in
harming 2.5 million and resulting in 350 000 deaths (CITE). Around 5%-
10% of autopsied patients show signs of misdiagnosis being a
contributing factor for the patients death (cite). A study of 300 000
new York hospital cases found that 14% of errors where diagnostic in
nature (CITE).

Data that separates where the error has happened and where the greatest
chance of OFI exist are rare. There are many studies on errors in the
emergency room, but not many describing specific instances of error in
the general ward. Adverse events, defined as "a harmful and negative
outcome which happens when a patient has been provided with medical
care" have been used in many studies (CITE). Adverse events due to
surgery was deemed the highest risk of adverse events in a hospital
setting according to paper (CITE) in where, 66% of adverse events
happened in a surgical setting, and the article discussed that around
50% of these adverse events were preventable.\
Data about doctor error in the High-dependency unit is rare and seems
not to have been studied specifically, thus it's hard to generalize
about specific OFI at this care level according to previous articles. In
an older study from 2005, 50 errors involving 32 patients were made by
doctors in an ICU setting. These errors resulted in a higher mortality
rate (38% vs 9%). The errors were categorized as human failures in 73%
of cases, and as avoidable in 92% (CITE) A Swedish study involving 128
patient cases where the patients had died following ICU care, 22
patients having suffered avoidable adverse events were identified
(CITE). According to a study based on 35311 trauma patients being
treated from years 1998-2005, 2081 patients died and 51 patients deaths
were deemed to be possibly preventable. 28 (54.9%) of these patients
died in the ICU, 13 (25.5%) patients died in the opertating room and 5
(9.8%) died in the emergency room (CITE). All in all, according to World
health organisation, 1 in 10 patients are negatively impacted by doctor
error (CITE). More studies related to doctor error have been conducted
in the emergency ward setting, the operating theatre and the intensive
care unit compared to the general ward and the high-dependency unit.
This might point to the fact that there may be a larger amount of
opportunities for improvement in these less studied cohorts.

*The background/introduction should summarise the scope of the problem,
what is known about the problem, what is not known, what specific
knowledge gap the study is supposed to fill and why this is important.
It should end be stating the aim of the study. The background should be
4-5 paragraphs long and each paragraph should be between 3-5 sentences.
Strive to make the paragraphs about the same length.*

# Methods

To answer these questions, we will use the trauma care quality database
and trauma registry from Karolinska University hospital. Using these two
databases we will conduct a registry-based cohort study. The data
available in the trauma registry includes 14000 trauma patients and is
logged from the years 2012-2023. The data from the trauma care quality
database is a subset of the same data containing 8000 patients where
opportunities for improvement have also been logged. This project will
examine whether there are specific opportunities for improvement in
regards to the level of care these patients received. RStudio will be
used in order to extract the data needed to answer these questions.
Relevant literature will be found on Pubmed using relevant search
queries, including but not limited to "trauma", "level of care" and
"improvement". A 5% significance level and 95% confidence levels will be
used.

*Refer to the appropriate reporting guideline for details. If you are
developing, updating or validating a clinical prediction model then use
[TRIPOD](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/tripod-statement/).
If you are conducting an observational study, for example a cohort or
case control study in which you assess associations between some
exposure and an outcome then use
[STROBE](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/).*

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to find opportunities for
improvement regarding trauma and level of hospital care. Different
levels of hospital care may affect opportunities for improvement in the
treatment of adult patients with trauma.

# Project Update and Timeline

Week 1: - Introduce myself to the NOACS team. - Familiarize myself with
GitHub, RStudio. - Attend lectures and take part of material from
Karolinska.

Week 2: -- Start looking at relevant articles for background. - Create
first draft of the project plan - Create first draft of the manuscript -
Learn how to use RStudio by practising in the program Swirl.

Week 3: - Compile all relevant articles for the project plan, and most
of the relevant articles for the background. - Create a version of the
project plan that's almost finished (finished from my end, pending
control from my supervisor) - Use Zotero for the references - Start
using RStudio in order to work with the relevant data Week 4 - Revise
project plan based on feedback from supervisor. - Add code that creates
a first table of sample characteristics. - Work with the code and with
RStudio Week 5- 7 - Keep writing introduction and methods - Write code
that generates results based on the training data. Revise the code based
on feedback from my supervisor and team.

Week 7-10 - Work on the real patient data with my code. Revise code as
needed Week 11-12 - Write results part of thesis.

Week 13-14 - Revise results based on feedback - Write discussion Week
15 - Revise discussion based on feedback - Draft complete thesis

Week 16-17 - Revise thesis and abstract as needed Week 18 -- 20 - Revise
based on feedback from Karolinska

Right now I'm currently learning how to code in RStudio, which is taking
up most of my time. I'm also looking for relevant articles in order to
start writing the introduction part of the thesis. The data I'm going to
be looking at is register based data using patient data registers at
Karolinska. I'm going to create a code which looks at variables
concerning level of care and opportunities for improvement. I'm not
entirely sure how I will present this data, but some sort of graph seems
to me a good choice. I will have to analyze it first, and possibly also
draft the "results" part of the thesis before I decide on the best
course of action.

Ethical permit and consideration Ethical permit: 2021-02541, 2021-03531
and 2023-02975-02 In this project, personal patient data will be used
without identifying the patient. It will also be done without the
patient's direct consent. There are, however, no reason to believe that
a patient would not accept being part of registry if asked. Care will be
taken in order to not spread the data to people outside of the scope of
the study. The purpose of this study is to improve the quality of care
for trauma patients. There are no apparent risks that this study may be
used for malicious use. It is possible that this study may be used for
future commercial use by a private health center. This would most likely
be to the benefit of the patients in this health center and is therefore
not a valid reason for not publishing this study. It's possible that
when spending time on this study, time and resources are used that could
be better spent elsewhere, and on other studies. This is an argument
that could be made of every study ever made, and since this study is not
using up any finite resource (except for arguably time), this is not a
valid argument for discontinuing the study.

# Back-up Plan

This paper depend to a large part on my ability to create good enough
code. I don't appreciate any significant problems regarding other areas,
though they my certainly arise. I will communicate clearly to my
supervisor in case I don't manage to create good enough code, and
hopefully the team will have a good way of helping me learn how to code.
