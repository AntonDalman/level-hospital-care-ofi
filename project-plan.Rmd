# Introduction

*This is part A) in the project plan [sv: projektredogörelse].*


Background
Trauma, globally and in Sweden
Trauma is an injury due to accident or violence, often happening suddenly [@Dumovich2024-wn]. Trauma is commonly divided in three groups, blunt force, penetrating force and brain injury, but a patient in a trauma setting may suffer from all three of these. A dreaded consequence of trauma is haemorrhagic shock, which is when organs in the body start shutting down as a consequence of blood loss [@noauthor_undated-yj]. Globally there exist several trauma registries which are used to collect data regarding trauma treatment and patient outcomes [@Moore2008-nn]. 
Trauma is a global issue affecting millions of people every year worldwide. The exact numbers differ due to different methods of gathering data, and data availability. Worldwide, somewhere between 4-6 million people die every year due to trauma, and around 40 million get permanently injured and 100 million people get temporarily injured each year [@Murray2022-o]. In Sweden, during 2023, 5221 people died due to external cause of death [@noauthor_undated-yp]. The level of care a trauma patient receives can differ between hospitals, regions and countries. The level of care can differ according to severity of injury, but also according to local regulations, space and economical concerns. 
Trauma care modalities commonly used are x-ray, bedside ultrasound and CT-scan in order to locate bleeding [@James2024-op]. Trauma care is ideally carried out by a trained team, and in accordance with a concept such as the ATLS-concept. 
There exists several trauma registries worldwide, which are used in order to evaluate trauma care and in order to improve trauma care [@Moore2008-nn]. These registries commonly contain patient information, such as sex, age, type of injury, as well as morbidity and mortality outcomes. The Karolinska Hospital trauma center have a trauma registry where opportunities for improvement and level of care is included, among other variables [@Albaaj2023-el].  
Opportunities for improvement 
Opportunities for improvement (OFI) can be defined as “preventable factors affecting morbidity and mortality”. The factors included in are the following: “clinical judgement errors, delays in treatment or diagnosis, missed diagnoses, technical errors, preventable deaths and other errors” [@Oreilly2013-ps]. OFI or OFI-like parameters are commonly logged in trauma registries. OFI-like parameters can be variables such as adverse events, defined as “a harmful and negative outcome which happens when a patient has been provided with medical care” [@Skelly2024-jj]. Adverse events is a commonly used parameter in various studies. 
Levels of care and opportunities for improvement
Level of care can be summarised according to five categories. In order of most care to least care is “emergency department, general ward, operating theatre, high dependency unit and critical care unit”. These are based on the Utstein template [@Ringdal2008-du], a template used in trauma registries for reporting several trauma care variables. Depending on the severity of the injury each patient supposedly ends up in a higher care level. A higher care level equals more doctors, nurses and staff, as well as access to more complex machinery. However, it also equals a higher cost, and a larger drain of resources. 
There are many studies on OFI, or OFI-like factors in the emergency room and operative theatre, but not many in the general ward and in the high dependency ward, thus it’s hard to generalize about specific OFI at these levels of care according to previous articles. 
Emergency ward and diagnostical error
Clinical judgement errors are somewhat common in the emergency ward, according to a systematic review published in 2022 [@Newman-Toker2022-xc]. In the study 5.7% of patients had at least one diagnostic error, resulting in harm becoming 2% of patients and death in about 0.2%. These percentages are low, but due to the amount of traffic emergency wards receive – about 130 million patients every year in the US, this results in 7 million patients misdiagnosed, harm becoming 2.5 million and 350 000 patients dying. Overall in a hospital setting, around 5%- 10% of autopsied patients show signs of misdiagnosis being a contributing factor for the patient death [@Graber2005-kg]. A study of 300 000 new York hospital cases found that 14% of errors were diagnostic in nature [@Clark2018-kr].   
Operative theatre
Adverse events due to surgery was deemed the highest risk of adverse events in a hospital setting according to one paper [@noauthor_undated-gk] in which 66% of adverse events happened in a surgical setting. The article discusses that  around 50% of these adverse events were preventable. In a systematic review containing 16424 surgical patients, 14.4% of patients experienced adverse events and 50% of these were deemed avoidable [@Anderson2013-ez]. 
Intensive care unit
In a study from 2005, 50 errors involving 32 patients were made by doctors in an ICU setting [@Graf2005-ji]. These errors resulted in a higher mortality rate (38% vs 9%). The errors were categorised as human failures in 73% of cases, and as avoidable in 92%. In a Swedish study involving 128 patients where the patients had died following or during ICU care, 22 patients having suffered avoidable adverse events were identified [@Nilsson2012-bn]. 

Area of further research
In a study based on 35311 trauma patients being treated from years 1998-2005, 2081 patients died. 51 patients’ deaths were deemed to be possibly preventable. 28 (54.9%) of these patients died in the ICU, 13 (25.5%) patients died in the operating room and 5 (9.8%) died in the emergency room [@Teixeira2007-dz]. All in all, according to the World Health Organisation, 1 in 10 patients are negatively impacted by doctor error [@noauthor_undated-if]. 
More studies related to doctor error have been conducted in the emergency ward setting, the operating theatre and the intensive care unit compared to the general ward and the high-dependency unit. This might point to the fact that there may be possible to affect a larger number of opportunities for improvement in these less studied cohorts.
There have been several studies previously regarding OFI and OFI-like factors in a trauma setting, but few studies with the direct focus on how OFI relates to care level. Previous studies show that there exists a connection between OFI and level of care [@Albaaj2023-el], but this connection has not been examined directly. There exist studies on specific OFI or OFI-like factors in specific levels of care, but there have not been any systematic approaches made were the same measure for OFI gets compared across different care levels. 
Aim
The aim of this study is to determine the number of opportunities for improvement in each level of in-hospital care, and how patient factors are associated with these opportunities at each level.

# Methods

Study design
This is a registry-based cohort study. 
Setting
This study will be conducted using data collected at Karolinska University Hospital trauma center, a level I trauma center [@noauthor_undated-xw]. Opportunities for improvement are since 2017 in Karolinska Hospital measured by a specialised nurse, who reviews all trauma patient cases and flags cases where OFI might be found [@Albaaj2023-el]. The cases flagged then get reviewed at a deeper level by another specialised nurse, and the cases where OFI might be found gets reviewed by a multidisciplinary conference, where cases are either admitted or discarded. All patients dying due to trauma are also discussed in a conference where OFI is also discussed. Before 2017 OFI was decided by a small group of clinicians.
We will use the trauma care quality database and trauma registry from Karolinska University hospital in this paper. The data available in the trauma registry includes 14000 trauma patients and is logged from the years 2012-2023. The data from the trauma care quality database is a subset of the same data containing 8000 patients where opportunities for improvement have also been logged. The data contains information according to the Utstein template, which includes factors such as Glasgow come scale, systolic blood pressure and respiratory rate [@Ringdal2008-du]. 
Participants 
The patients included are all above the age of 15, with an ISS greater than 9 or patients with a trauma team activation upon hospital arrival. Excluded patients were younger than 15 or dead on arrival. 
Outcome measures
The first outcome measure is the number of opportunities for improvement at each level of care. Which patient factors correlate with what level of care and number of OFI will be measured secondarily.  
Variables
Our outcome is measured specifically in regard to level of in hospital care, which means that several variables need to be taken into account. The following patient factors will be included: patient age, injury mechanism, ASA score preinjury, Glascow come scale at arrival to hospital, systolic blood pressure at arrival, respiratory rate at arrival, base excess at arrival, injury severity score (ISS), highest level of in hospital care and OFI. Level of hospital care is numbered from 1-5, with 1 representing the emergency ward, 2 representing the general ward, 3 representing the operative theatre, 4 representing the high dependency unit and 5 representing the intensive care unit. 
Statistical analysis
R will be used for the statistical analysis. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression will be used to determine the associations between level of care and opportunities for improvement. Multivariable logistic regression, and bivariable logistic regression will be used. Synthetic data will be used when developing the code required to extract data. When this code is deemed functional, it will be implemented on the real data. This is done to decrease risk of bias. A 5% significance level and 95% confidence levels will be used in this paper.

Patients included in this study have had their personal identification number replaced with a study number in order to hinder the possibility of identifying specific patients. However, the data used in this project contains a lot of patient information. Putting together the different variables used may make it possible to identify a specific patient. Care has been taken in order not to spread the data by working on a password protected secured server.  
Patients included in the trauma registry have not needed to consent to be included in the registry. All included patients have been informed of their participation and have had the opportunity to opt out of the registry. 
The trauma registry used in this study is run by employees of the hospital evaluated by the registry. This means that there is the possibility that information in the registry that puts the hospital in a bad light may have been excluded from the registry, either consciously or unconsciously. In order to minimize the risk of this the group working with the trauma registry work independently of the rest of the hospital. Internal regulations are also in place, such as the OFI variable being examined in connection with all trauma patients who die in the hospital. 
The purpose of this study is to improve the quality of care for trauma patients. There are no apparent risks that this study may be used for malicious use. It is possible that this study may be used for future commercial use by a private health centre. This would most likely be to the benefit of the patients in this health centre and is therefore not a valid reason for not publishing this study.
The goal of this study is to find out how OFI differ between care levels and examine why OFI differ. This study is part of a large group of studies with the purpose of examining OFI in trauma patients. The eventual goal of this entire project is to reduce OFI in trauma patients, thus enabling better trauma care and likely improving mortality and morbidity.

# Project Update and Timeline

Week 1: - Introduce myself to the NOACS team. - Familiarize myself with
GitHub, RStudio. - Attend lectures and take part of material from
Karolinska.

Week 2: -- Start looking at relevant articles for background. - Create
first draft of the project plan - Create first draft of the manuscript -
Learn how to use RStudio by practising in the program Swirl.

Week 3: - Compile all relevant articles for the project plan, and most
of the relevant articles for the background. - Create a version of the
project plan that's almost finished (finished from my end, pending
control from my supervisor) - Use Zotero for the references - Start
using RStudio in order to work with the relevant data Week 4 - Revise
project plan based on feedback from supervisor. - Add code that creates
a first table of sample characteristics. - Work with the code and with
RStudio Week 5- 7 - Keep writing introduction and methods - Write code
that generates results based on the training data. Revise the code based
on feedback from my supervisor and team.

Week 7-10 - Work on the real patient data with my code. Revise code as
needed Week 11-12 - Write results part of thesis.

Week 13-14 - Revise results based on feedback - Write discussion Week
15 - Revise discussion based on feedback - Draft complete thesis

Week 16-17 - Revise thesis and abstract as needed Week 18 -- 20 - Revise
based on feedback from Karolinska

Right now I'm currently learning how to code in RStudio, which is taking
up most of my time. I'm also looking for relevant articles in order to
start writing the introduction part of the thesis. The data I'm going to
be looking at is register based data using patient data registers at
Karolinska. I'm going to create a code which looks at variables
concerning level of care and opportunities for improvement. I'm not
entirely sure how I will present this data, but some sort of graph seems
to me a good choice. I will have to analyze it first, and possibly also
draft the "results" part of the thesis before I decide on the best
course of action.

Ethical permit and consideration Ethical permit: 2021-02541, 2021-03531
and 2023-02975-02 In this project, personal patient data will be used
without identifying the patient. It will also be done without the
patient's direct consent. There are, however, no reason to believe that
a patient would not accept being part of registry if asked. Care will be
taken in order to not spread the data to people outside of the scope of
the study. The purpose of this study is to improve the quality of care
for trauma patients. There are no apparent risks that this study may be
used for malicious use. It is possible that this study may be used for
future commercial use by a private health center. This would most likely
be to the benefit of the patients in this health center and is therefore
not a valid reason for not publishing this study. It's possible that
when spending time on this study, time and resources are used that could
be better spent elsewhere, and on other studies. This is an argument
that could be made of every study ever made, and since this study is not
using up any finite resource (except for arguably time), this is not a
valid argument for discontinuing the study.

# Back-up Plan

This paper depend to a large part on my ability to create good enough
code. I don't appreciate any significant problems regarding other areas,
though they my certainly arise. I will communicate clearly to my
supervisor in case I don't manage to create good enough code, and
hopefully the team will have a good way of helping me learn how to code.
