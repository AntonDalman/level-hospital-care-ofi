# Association between level of hospital care and specific opportunities for improvement in adult trauma patients

This repository includes the documents and code for the research project on the association between level of hospital care and specific opportunities for improvement in adult trauma patients. 

## Summary

### Introduction
Trauma - physical injury and the bodyâ€™s associated response - is a major cause of death and
disability worldwide. Every year, over four million people die from trauma, and it is the top cause
of burden of disease in young people. Trauma quality improvement programmes aim to identify
opportunities for improvement in the care of trauma patients, and to implement changes to
improve patient outcomes. Trauma patients are managed at all levels of hospital care, from the
emergency department to the ward and the intensive care unit. Previous research has shown that
the level of hospital care is associated with opportunities for improvement overall, but it is not
known how specific opportunities for improvement differ between levels of hospital care.

### Aim
This study aims to identify the association between the level of hospital care and specific
opportunities for improvement in adult trauma patients.

### Methods
This is a registry based cohort study using data from the trauma registry and trauma care quality
database at the Karolinska University Hospital in Solna. The trauma registry includes about
14000 patients treated between 2012 and 2023. The trauma care quality database is a subset of the
trauma registry and includes about 8000 patients selected for review between 2014 and 2023. The
outcome is specific opportunities for improvement, such as delayed management or technical
errors, as identified by a multidisciplinary trauma quality improvement review board and
recorded in the trauma care quality database. This project will link the two databases and assess
what types of OFI occurred in patients managed at and how they differed between different levels
of hospital care. A 5% significance level and 95% confidence levels will be used.
